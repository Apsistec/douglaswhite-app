              Douglas White is a <b>Web Application Developer</b> who utilizes
              JavaScript web frameworks and libraries to design and develop apps
              that look great on all mobile devices and platforms by utilizing
              base themes that adapt to each platform. He produces fully
              featured solutions for clients that enables rapid prototype design
              while still offering complex features. Using these modern web
              frameworks also texts to better market penetration and less churn
              due in part to auto scaling infrastructure. Caching data on a
              global content delivery network improves app responsiveness and
              reduces operational expenses. Furthermore, the apps can be shipped
              to the app stores and as a progressive web app, all from a single
              code base.

              Just over 3 years ago, he was presented with a position that
              provided him a chance to learn JavaScript. So, he jumped at the
              opportunity and has never looked back. Douglas is developing apps
              using <b>Ionic</b> and <b>Angular</b> Frameworks,
              <b>Google Cloud Platform</b>, and <b>Firebase</b>. He is also
              forever committed to learning, and has specifically begun working
              with <b>SVG</b>, <b>D3</b>, <b>TensorFlow</b> and
              <b>Actions on Google</b> to bring animations, data visualizations,
              machine learning and voice interactions under his belt.

              Douglas has worked in the IT industry for over 15 years, starting
              as a
              <b>network technician</b>, followed by positions working with
              business leaders as a <b>software sales representative</b> and as
              a <b>IT services consultant</b>. He understands how to communicate
              with business leaders, he knows how important their expectations
              are, and ultimately he knows how to deliver to them. His intrinsic
              interest in the sciences along with an ingrained desire to
              understand how things work have allowed him to keep at the
              forefront of the IT industry. He is a self-starter and fully
              autonomous; but he does enjoy the the company of peers and works
              well in any team. Douglas enjoys that feeling of success achieved
