                Douglas White is a Web Application Developer who like a chemist
                mixes together components from a set of known materials in

                products. He is versed in using JavaScript libraries to design
                and develop web apps that look great on mobile, desktop, and
                even larger devices by utilizing themes which adapt to each
                platform. He is effecient at developing complex, fully featured
                solutions for clients using NodeJS front-end frameworks that
                enable rapid prototype review. Ultimately, the suite of tools
                and servies Douglas currently uses provide the fastest means to
                ship apps to both app stores and as a progressive web app(PWA),

                Once an app is deployed, Douglas combines user analytics with
                other tools and services to establish a concise approach for
                effectively improving outcomes. This combination of services
                offers user tracking across devices, A/B testing automation, and
                automated user segment customizations which helps guide the user
                along each stage of the the customer journey. Additionally,
                analytic funnel analysis provides a means for more rapid market
                penetration with less churn. Using Google's cloud based
                Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS) a.k.a. Google Cloud
                Platform(GCP), Douglas uses his evolved knowledge of DevOps to
                keep operational costs radically reduced. Features such as
                auto-scaling all backend resources, edge caching of user data
                across a global content delivery network (CDN), and serverless
                functions all improve app responsiveness while greatly reducing
                operational expenses. Douglas has experience working in an
                autonomous environment although he is a team player. Thus he is
                quite comfortable working alone or in an Agile environment where
                utilizing Scrum and/or team coding along with continuous
                integration, continuous deployment(CI/CD) can greatly improve
                coding effeciences.

                Douglas began working in the IT industry at an ISP as a network
                technician over fifteen years ago. His career path led him to
                more advanced positions where he eventually found himself
                working with C-level business leaders as a software sales
                representative and as a IT services consultant. Thus, he
                understands how to communicate with business leaders, he knows
                how important their expectations are, and he knows how to
                deliver on those expectations. His intrinsic interest in the
                sciences along with an ingrained desire to understand how things
                work have allowed him to keep at the forefront of the IT
                industry. He is a self-starter, but he does enjoy the company of
                peers and he works well on any team. Douglas is results driven
                and he truly enjoys the feeling of success achieved upon
                implementing a complex solution that enables a client to make an
                impact in their market. He also has every intention to continue
                in that success.

                Just over 3 years ago, Douglas was presented with a position
                that provided him the opportunity to learn JavaScript, a long
                held desire. So, he jumped at the chance and has never looked
                back. He enjoys developing web apps using Ionic & Angular web
                frameworks, Google Cloud Platform and Firebase. He has a
                lifelong commitment to continuing education in his field, and he
                has specifically been working with SVG, D3, TensorFlow and
                Actions on Google in order to bring animations, data
                visualizations, machine learning and voice interactions under
                his belt.
