              Douglas White is a Web Application Developer who uses JavaScript
              libraries to design and develop web apps that look great on all
              mobile, desktop, and even larger devices utilizing themes that
              adapt to each platform. He efficiently develops complex, fully
              featured solutions for clients using NodeJS front-end frameworks
              that enable complex features and rapid prototype design.
              Ultimately, the suite of tools and servies Douglas has chosen the
              suite of tools and services to build apps because they provide a
              means to shipp apps to both app stores and as a progressive web
              app(PWA), all from one codebase.
            </p>

              Once deployed, Douglas combines the user analytics with a highly
              specialized suite of services which provides an effective means of
              improving outcomes. The combination of services offers user
              tracking across devices, A/B testing automation, and automated
              user segment customizations which helps guide the user along each
              stage of the the customer journey. Funnel analysis ultimately
              provides the neans for quicker market penetration with less churn.
              By using Google's cloud based Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS),
              Google Cloud Platform(GCP) DevOps, Douglas keeps operational costs
              radically reduced. Features such as auto-scaling all backend
              resources, edge caching of user data across a global content
              delivery network, and serverless functions all improve app
              responsiveness while greatly reducing operational expenses.
              Douglas is a team player and thus he is quite comfortable working
              in an Agile environment using Scrum and/or team coding along with
              continuous integration, continuous deployment(CI/CD) to improve
              coding effeciences when working with a team of developers.

              Just over 3 years ago, he was presented with a position that
              provided him a chance to learn JavaScript. So, he jumped at the
              opportunity and has never looked back. Douglas develops web apps
              using Ionic & Angular web frameworks, Google Cloud Platform and
              Firebase. He has a lifelong commitment to continuing education in
              his field, and has specifically been working with SVG, D3,
              TensorFlow and Actions on Google in order to bring animations,
              data visualizations, machine learning and voice interactions under
              his belt.

              Douglas began working in the IT industry at an ISP as a network
              technician over fifteen years ago. His career path led him to more
              advanced positions where he eventually was working with C-level
              business leaders as a software sales representative and as a IT
              services consultant. He understands how to communicate with
              business leaders, he knows how important their expectations are,
              and ultimately he knows how to deliver to them. His intrinsic
              interest in the sciences along with an ingrained desire to
              understand how things work have allowed him to keep at the
              forefront of the IT industry. He is a self-starter and fully
              autonomous; but he does enjoy the the company of peers and works
              well in any team. Douglas enjoys that feeling of success achieved
              upon implementing a complex solution that enables a client to
              truly make an impact in their market, and he has every intention
              to continue in that success.
